# [semgrep](https://semgrep.dev)

[`semgrep`](https://semgrep.dev) (syntactic grep) is an open-source tool for finding patterns in code. It's useful for preventing the use of known anti-patterns in a codebase or enforcing the correct use of secure-by-default frameworks (e.g. always use a project's sanitization method on user-provided data).

semgrep is fast and powerful; it's grep-esque patterns are lifted into AST matchers. Compared to regexes these patterns arenâ€™t affected by whitespaces, comments, newlines, the order of keyword arguments, variable renaming, and other language nuances.

Currently, the supported languages are: C, Go, Java, JavaScript, and Python.

## Configuration

There are two types of rules in Semgrep:

1) [Simple rules](https://github.com/returntocorp/semgrep#simple-rules) - expressed with a single `pattern`.
2) [Advanced rules](https://github.com/returntocorp/semgrep#advanced-rules) - expressed with multiple patterns, like: X must be true AND Y must be too, or X but NOT Y, or X must occur inside a block of code that Y matches.  These patterns are composed with the `patterns` keyword.

In salus.yaml, both simple and advanced rules can be specified with a path to a [Semgrep YAML config file](https://github.com/returntocorp/semgrep/blob/develop/docs/configuration-files.md).
In adddition, simple rules can be specified directly in salus.yaml.

### Specifying path to Semgrep YAML config

In salus.yaml, you can specify a set of semgrep rules with a path to a [Semgrep config file](https://github.com/returntocorp/semgrep/blob/develop/docs/configuration-files.md).  You **must** specify

* `config` - a full Semgrep config file/directory. This config can either be nested inside the repo, or start with `/` if the path also contains `semgrep`.
* Either `required: true` or `forbidden: true`
  - If a found pattern is forbidden or if a not found pattern is required, then the scanner will fail and the `message` will be show to the developer in the report.

In addition, you can **optionally** specify

* `exclude` - Skip any file or directory that matches this pattern
  - `--exclude='*.py'` will ignore the following: foo.py,
    src/foo.py, foo.py/bar.sh. --exclude='tests' will ignore tests/foo.py as well as a/b/tests/c/foo.py. Can add
    multiple times.

Here is an example semgrep section of a salus.yaml.

```yaml
scanner_configs:
  Semgrep:
    matches:
      - config: semgrep_config_1.yaml
        forbidden: true
      - config: semgrep_config_2.yaml
        forbidden: true
        exclude:
          - tests
```

Example semgrep_config_1.yaml.  The rule says find all patterns of the form
`$X == $X`, but exclude `0 == 0`.
```yaml
rules:
  - id: eqeq-always-true
    patterns:
      - pattern: $X == $X
      - pattern-not: 0 == 0
    message: "$X == $X is always true"
    languages: [python]
    severity: ERROR
```
Keywords in this file:
* `id` - Unique, descriptive identifier, cannot contain whitespaces (required)
* `patterns` or `pattern` - patterns or pattern or pattern-regex (required)
* `message` - Message if rule (forbidden and found) or (required and not found) (optional)
* `languages` - Any of: c, go, java, javascript, or python (required)
* `severity` - One of: WARNING, ERROR (required)


### Adding simple rule directly (without Semgrep config file)

Simple rules that can be expressed with a single `pattern` can be directly specified in salus.yaml.
Each simple rule in salus.yaml **must** include

* `pattern` - the single pattern
* `forbidden: true` or `required: true
* `language`- Any of: c, go, java, javascript, or python
* `sub-dir` - this pattern will apply only to the sub-dir listed. This should be a valid sub-directory under the directory defined by "directories" under "recursion" config

The user can **optionally** provide
* `exclude` - Skip any file or directory that matches this pattern
  - `--exclude='*.py'` will ignore the following: foo.py,
    src/foo.py, foo.py/bar.sh. --exclude='tests' will ignore tests/foo.py as well as a/b/tests/c/foo.py. Can add
    multiple times.
* `message` - Message if rule (forbidden and found) or (required and not found)

Example,

```yaml
scanner_configs:
  Semgrep:
    matches:
      - pattern: $X == $X
        message: Useless equlity check
        language: python
        forbidden: true
        exclude:
          - tests
      - pattern: $X.unsanitize(...)
        message: Don't call `unsanitize()` methods without careful review
        language: js
        forbidden: true
        exclude:
          - node_modules
      - pattern: $LOG_ENDPOINT = os.getenv("LOGGER_ENDPOINT", ...)
        message: All files need to get the dynamic logger. Please don't hardcode this.
        language: python
        required: true
```

## Whitelisting Findings

Please see [semgrep's documentation on how to use an inline comment to allowlist findings](https://semgrep.dev/docs/ignoring-files-folders-code/#reference-summary).

You can also whitelist all findings for specific ids in the salus config, like
```yaml
scanner_configs:
  Semgrep:
    exceptions:
      - advisory_id: myid1
        changed_by: engineer1
        notes: false positive because ...
      - advisory_id: myid2
        changed_by: engineer2
        notes: false positive because ...
```

## Limitations of Semgrep

* There may be parser-related issues from Semgrep
  - Parser-related issues will be displayed as warnings and do not cause salus to fail.
  - Salus will still show semgrep results from files that do not have parser issues.
* Salus semgrep currently does not support scanning against [pre-built rules.](https://github.com/returntocorp/semgrep#run-pre-built-rules)
  - But we plan to support this in the near future!
