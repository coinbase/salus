# The default config file for Salus.
#
# You can specify a `salus.yaml` file in the root of your project to override any of these defaults.
# For more complex configuration, including the concatenation of global and local files, you can
# use use the --config flag to specify multiple files (local or remote) to parse.

# enforced_scanners are scanners that cause Salus to exit !0 when they fail.
# Controlling this list will allow you to choose which scanners must pass for
# a CI environment to show a successful build and, by omission, allow you to run new
# scanners in test mode while they are being tuned or rolled out across a fleet of builds.
#
# By default, we enforce all scanners which we deem to have low false positive rates.
# Strong defaults lowers the risk of misconfiguration that could fail closed if configuration
# was necessary to ensure that certain scanners pass.
# Other scanners may need to graduate from the testing phase or
# should only be enforced explicitly by custom configuration.
